            Paul Balke & Michiel van Cranenburgh have joined forces based on a shared passion for the tradition of Italian wine. Inspired by the hard work and
            dedication of so many winemakers that represent the best of Italian quality, style and elegance. The Italian wine industry is highly
            fragmented with thousands of often family owned companies that operate only a few hectares of vineyards. Some of these small
            wineries produce wines of the highest quality that can be found in the best restaurants and wine stores around the world. Foreign
            investors find it difficult to acquire high quality vineyard assets in Italy. The fragmentation of the industry, the general weariness
            to sell to non-family members and the language and cultural barriers often prevent successful cross-border investments.

    <div class="flex-fill p-4">
            Vineyard Access Italia has a vast network of contacts with the families behind the local wine producers, in particular in Piemonte, Puglia,
            Tuscany and Friuli.
            We support family owned Italian wineries that are seeking a future-proof solution through outside investments
            or an outright sale of their business.
            We realize that investing in an Italian wine business is often much more than acquiring a vineyard or winery asset. As an investor
            you obtain a foothold in Italy and its way of life. You will need a reliable and capable on site team to manage your investment. Farmhouses can be developed into luxury accommodation and/or a family home.
            Investors can cooperate with local winemakers to grow and upgrade a business. Are you looking for an investment in the Italian
            wine business? We can offer you access to off-market investment opportunities.

                    Michiel van Cranenburgh (1966) is an independent
                    advisor supporting families and family-owned
                    companies in a wide variety of wealth matters.
                    He has a strong investment background having
                    worked for 25+ years in wealth management,
                    structured finance and banking. Michiel is a true
                    global citizen having spent most of his career living

                    Over the years Michiel has worked with many family owned companies
                    that face challenges when it comes to handing over to the next
                    generation, in the wine industry as anywhere else. When not travelling
                    in Italy he can be found on the water or in the mountains. Michiel is
